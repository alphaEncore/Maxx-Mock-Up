Hello my name is William Gaston. This was a project that was given to me to complete during a career lab with Maxx Potential. This was the first website that I've built just using HTML & CSS. During the lab we were given about an hour to get as much done as possible. The two problems that I've run into were the color change on the "horizontal rule" and the footer is showing thinner than it is in the picture that was provided. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
